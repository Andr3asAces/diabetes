Project for the IBM course Deep learning and Reinforcement learning:

- Trained a neural network  using Tensorflow to predict diabetes on the Pima Diabetes Dataset.  

- Trained a baseline Random forest and compared the performance with the neural network model.

- Experimented with different neural network architectures (feel free to try yourself) and 

- The most improtant findings are highlighted at the end of the notebook! Dont' miss em!
